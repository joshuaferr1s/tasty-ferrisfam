title: Sausage Skillet
cookTime: 20
servings: 1
ingredients:
  - 3 slices of thin sliced bacon, cut into bite size pieces
  - 1 bunch of brocolli with florets cut into bite size pieces
  - 2 polish sausage links, sliced into bite size pieces

steps:
  - Fry bacon in a nonstick pan and when cooked entirely remove the bacon from the pan but leave the grease.
  - Add the Saute Express square to the pan and stir quickly to melt.
  - Toss in broccoli and continue to stir non-stop until broccoli is almost completed.
