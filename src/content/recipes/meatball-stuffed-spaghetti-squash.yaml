title: Meatball-Stuffed Spaghetti Squash
cookTime: 70
servings: 4
ingredients:
  - 2 medium spaghetti squash (about 5 pounds total)
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil
  - 1 teaspoon kosher salt
  - ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
  - 4 cloves garlic, smashed
  - 1 cup marinara sauce
  - ¼ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese (about 1 ounce)
  - ¼ cup torn fresh basil leaves, plus more for garnish
  - ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
  - 12 ounces precooked meatballs [about 12 (1 ½-inch) meatballs], thawed if frozen
  - ¾ cup whole-milk low-moisture shredded mozzarella cheese
steps:
  - Arrange a rack in the middle the oven and heat to 400°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil; set aside.
  - Cut each squash in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. Brush the cut sides of each squash with the oil and season with the salt and pepper. Place cut-side down in a single layer on the baking sheet, placing one garlic clove under each piece of squash. Roast until the squash are soft when poked with a fork and the skin is browned and blistered, about 40 minutes.
  - Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Flip the squash over with tongs and remove and discard the garlic. Use a fork to shred the inside of each squash half, leaving about 1/2 inch of unshredded squash left in the shell. Transfer the shredded squash to a large bowl. Add the sauce, Parmesan, basil, and red pepper flakes and stir to combine.
  - Evenly divide the shredded filling between the squash halves. Divide the meatballs over the filling, then top with the mozzarella cheese.
  - Bake until the meatballs are heated through and the cheese is melted, 15 to 20 minutes. Garnish with more fresh basil before serving.
