title: Homemade Gluten Free Crescent Rolls
cookTime: 100
servings: 6
ingredients:
  - 1 pkg active yeast
  - 6 tbsp warm water
  - 4 tbsp sugar
  - 1 ¾ cup gluten free flour
  - ¼ c. butter, softened, cut into small pieces
  - 1 egg
  - ½ tsp salt
  - additional 2 tbsp softened butter for spreading and basting
steps:
  - Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. (We are warming the oven to create an environment for proofing the dough. You will turn it off prior to putting the dough ball in the oven. Turn it off once it reaches 200 degrees)
  - To begin, proof your yeast. I use a glass 2 cup measuring cup to do this. Mix the yeast and 1 tbsp sugar together. To that, add your warm water and allow to proof for 5-10 minutes. It should easily double in size, if not more.
  - "**Update - You can also use instant rise yeast, which requires no proofing. Simply add the dry yeast to the blend of flour and sugar. Add warm water to the dough as the recipe calls for."
  - Meanwhile, in a stand mixer, combine the flour and chunks of softened butter. Using the paddle attachment, mix the flour and butter together. Do so until it all the butter is incorporated without large chunks.
  - To that add the egg, salt, 3 tbsp sugar and proofed yeast. (Or just warm water, if you used rapid rise yeast.) Turn stand mixer on low, and allow to run until all ingredients are mixed together and a dough forms.
  - TURN OVEN OFF. (If you haven't already.)
  - Place dough on a lightly floured surface. Using a rolling pin, roll into a 12 inch circle. Gently spread approximately 2 tbsp softened butter on top of dough.
  - Cut dough into 12 (or 8) sections. Working from the outside, roll each individual triangle towards the center to create your crescent. Place on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet, and repeat with remaining dough.
  - Place rolls in the warmed (but turned off) oven. Cover with a towel, and allow to rise for 30-45 minutes.
  - After rolls have risen to almost double their size, remove rolls from oven, and preheat oven to 350 degrees. While oven is heating, brush each roll with a thin coat of butter to prevent over browning while baking. Oil can also be used.
  - Once oven comes to temperature, bake rolls in oven for 12-15 minutes. I always rotate my pans halfway through the baking cycle.
  - After rolls are done, remove from oven, and serve warm. If desired, brush with any remaining melted butter.
  - Freeze any remaining rolls for later.
