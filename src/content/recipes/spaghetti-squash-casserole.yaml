cookTime: 70
servings: 12
ingredients:
  - 1 medium spaghetti squash
  - 1 lb ground beef
  - ¼ onion, chopped
  - 1 jar spaghetti sauce
  - 8 oz of sour cream
  - ½ cup parmesan cheese
  - 1 tbsp italian seasoning
  - 1 ½ cups shredded mozzarella
  - salt and pepper, to taste
steps:
  - First, put the spaghetti squash and a cup of water into the instant pot and cook on manual high for 20-30 minutes.
  - Once cool, use a fork and scrape out the squash. It will look like spaghetti noodles. Set aside.
  - In a large saute pan, cook the ground beef over medium high heat with some salt and pepper.
  - Add in the onions and cook until transparent.
  - Once the ground beef is browned, drain off the grease and add in the spaghetti sauce, sour cream, parmesan cheese, and italian seasoning and stir well.
  - Next add in the spaghetti squash and mix together until well combined.
  - Pour the mixture into a greased 9 x 13 inch pan and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese.
  - Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes with a piece of foil covering over the top of the pan.
  - During the last 5 minutes, remove the foil so that the cheese browns slightly.
  - Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.
