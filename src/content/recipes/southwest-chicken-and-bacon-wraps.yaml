title: Southwest Chicken and Bacon Wraps
cookTime: 130
servings: 8
ingredients:
  - 2 pounds chicken tenders (or you can use chicken breasts)
  - 1 batch of Southwest Chicken Marinade
  - 8 slices (about a half pound) bacon, fully cooked and crumbled (try our No Fail Bacon method)
  - 1 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend (or shredded cheddar)
  - Shredded lettuce
  - Diced tomatoes
  - "1 or 2 batches of Creamy Southwest Ranch Sauce (sub: combine 1:1 ratio of salsa and store-bought Ranch Dip)"
  - 8 burrito-sized whole wheat tortillas
steps:
  - "Marinate the Chicken: In a gallon-sized freezer bag or container, add the chicken to the Southwest Chicken Marinade. (Freezing instructions begin here.) Seal and marinate in the refrigerator for 2-24 hours."
  - "Grill the Chicken: Preheat grill to medium-high heat and clean the grates well. Grill for about 4-5 minutes per side, maybe longer depending on the thickness, until done. Chicken is done when it registers 165Â°F internally or has no more pink inside. Let chicken rest on a cutting board and then dice into bite-sized pieces. (See other ways to cook your chicken in notes below.)"
  - "Assemble the Wrap: To each tortilla, add some grilled chicken, bacon pieces, 2 tablespoons shredded cheese, shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, and 2 tablespoons Creamy Southwest Ranch Sauce. Roll up like a burrito. Serve more Creamy Southwest Ranch Sauce on the side for dipping, if desired."
