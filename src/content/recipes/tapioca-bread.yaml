title: Tapioca Bread
cookTime: 30
servings: 1
ingredients:
  - 1 cup tapioca flour
  - 2 tbsp olive oil
  - 2 tbsp water
  - 1 egg
  - to taste dried basil
  - to taste salt
  - to taste garlic powder
  - to taste onion powder
steps:
  - Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
  - Pour flour and seasonings into medium size mixing bowl.
  - Then add in the wet ingredients of egg, oil, and water.
  - Mix really well. The tapioca tends to seize up when moisture is added, but it will eventually smooth out into a pourable dough mixture.
  - Pour onto baking sheet with a nonstick liner and bake for 15-20 minutes until edges become golden brown.
  - Over baking will result in dryness or something overly chewy. If a more flat bread consistency is desired add more water to the dough.
